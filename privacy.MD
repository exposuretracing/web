betterparent.net AND PARENTAL CONSENT
We require that parents give parental consent before using betterparent.net with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own.  This age may vary based on where you live. For example, in the US that age is younger than 13. You should check your local laws to determine the relevant age in your country. Parents or guardians can withdraw consent for the further collection of their child’s information at any time. If you are aware betterparent.net is collecting information from a student without parental consent, please contact us immediately at help@betterparent.net.me and we will delete the data.

Use our sample consent form - but please note that this is an example only and does not constitute legal advice.

WHO DOES betterparent.net COLLECT INFORMATION FROM?
Parents may create accounts on betterparent.net.  We also collect limited log-data from all visitors to our marketing website.
When parents add children to their accounts, using their children's Google Classroom login information, we collect their children's Google Classroom data.

WHAT INFORMATION DOES betterparent.net COLLECT?
Account Information: When parents create an account on betterparent.net we collect your name, email address, password, and profile picture. betterparent.net may also collect your phone number if you enter it in your Account Settings.

Students cannot create an account by themselves, but must be added to  a betterparent.net parent account by their parents. Where students have been added to betterparent.net, betterparent.net collects personally identifiable information about them including their names, email addresses, and profile picture. This information may be entered by student or populated from the student’s account with a third party sign-in service, such as their Google account.

Classroom Content: betterparent.net also collects content that is added to students' Google Classroom account.  This content may be courses, course works, student submissions, and course announcements. We regularly add types of information that can be uploaded to a Journal, and these are all covered by this Policy.  We also collect comments on posts in your classroom which may be text, or if you allow betterparent.net to access the microphone on your device, voice recordings.

Messages: betterparent.net collects messages that are sent and received in betterparent.net by teachers, parents, and students.

Communications: betterparent.net collects any information you send to us directly, such as email communications.

Information from your Google Account or other Third-Party Sign-in Service: betterparent.net allows parents and students to sign up for and log into our service using a Google account. When we create a betterparent.net account using one of these Third-Party Services, we use the name, profile picture, and email address (if available) provided by these services.

Log Data: When you use betterparent.net, we receive log data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, and your mobile carrier. In addition, we may receive or collect additional information such as the referring web page, referring search terms, and pages visited. betterparent.net may use your IP address to determine your approximate location for the purposes of sending you customized marketing and other information about our products.


HOW DOES betterparent.net USE THIS INFORMATION?
We only use this information to provide our services to you.  For example we use this information to:

Allow you to access and use our service by verifying your identity and storing your Classroom Content and Messages.

Provide parents with customer support.

Notify you about activity on and updates to your account or your child’s account (if you’ve indicated in your account settings that you’d like notifications).

Research, understand, and analyze trends of users to improve and develop new features for our products.

Promote enhancements to betterparent.net relevant for teachers, families and schools.

Investigate, prevent, and detect activities on our service that we believe may violate the law or applicable regulations. We may, at the request of a school, investigate accounts to determine whether they comply with school policies.

You can withdraw consent for the collection of your personal information at any time, and also opt-out of marketing communications from us.

DOES betterparent.net ALLOW ADVERTISING OR SHARE DATA FOR ADVERTISING?
Absolutely not. Our business model is straightforward: we charge for low monthly fee for our product and services, and have no interest in advertising within betterparent.net. We never display ads, allow third-party ads, share data for advertising or marketing purposes, or allow data collection by third-party advertisers or data brokers.


IN WHAT LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES MAY betterparent.net NEED TO SHARE MY INFORMATION?
We do not sell or share any data you provide with third parties except in the limited circumstances detailed below:

We use a small number of third-party services in order to operate and improve betterparent.net – for example a data center operator that manages our servers or a notification service that helps us send you messages about your account. These services need access to your personally identifiable information in order to work (i.e. your email address is required to send you email), but are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose other than to provide the betterparent.net service.

betterparent.net may disclose your information to a third party to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or a valid legal request - including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law.

By default Activities teachers create are private to their account. Optionally, teachers may choose to publish Activities they create to the Community Activity Library or the Activity Library managed by their school or district.  In these cases, the activity and the teacher’s Activity Author Profile will be shared publicly (in the case of the Community Library) or with other teachers at their school or district. No student responses to Activities are ever shared.

We may disclose or transfer your Account Information and Classroom Content in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your information. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your data as transferred to the new entity.


DO YOU COLLECT DATA ABOUT [BLANK]?
We’ve listed all the data we collect in the section above titled What Information Does betterparent.net Collect.  We intentionally limit our data collection to only what we need to provide the betterparent.net service for you.

However, sometimes we get asked if we collect data about some other topic or area that’s of particular interest to a school. To be clear, we do not collect biometric, behavioral, free or reduced lunch eligibility, health, or financial data.

DO YOU WORK WITH THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS SERVICES?
betterparent.net is constantly improving, and we use aggregate data about how betterparent.net is used -- for example what buttons you click on or what pages you visit -- to inform those decisions.

To help us analyze this data, we use a small number of third-party services (such as Google Analytics).  In no circumstances are any data you have shared with betterparent.net (such as your Account Information or Journal Content) shared with these services.  In addition, these services are contractually obligated only to use data about your usage of betterparent.net to provide analytics services to us and are prohibited from sharing it or using it for other purposes. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.


HOW DO YOU USE COOKIES?
Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your web browser that allow us to identify your web browser and store information about your account.  We use these cookies to keep you logged in to betterparent.net, customize your betterparent.net experience, understand how you use betterparent.net, and promote betterparent.net to relevant teachers and schools.

You can choose to remove or disable cookies via your browser settings. Please be aware that betterparent.net will not work properly if you disable or decline cookies.
